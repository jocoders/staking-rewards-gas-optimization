# Gas Optimization Audit Report - StakingRewards

## Overview

- **Contract Audited:** StakingRewardsOptimized.sol
- **Optimization Techniques Used:** Yul optimizations, slot packing, inline assembly, gas-efficient event logging, custom errors
- **Audit Focus:** Reducing gas costs for deployment and function execution
- **Findings Summary:**
  - **Deployment Gas Reduced:** 2,160,624 -> 1,548,556 (‚Üì 28.3%)
  - **Deployment Size Reduced:** 10,073 -> 7,349 (‚Üì 27.1%)
  - **Gas Savings on Function Calls:** Significant reductions across multiple functions

## Optimizations & Gas Savings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Moved RewardsDistributionRecipient Logic Inside Contract

- Previously, the contract used an external `RewardsDistributionRecipient` contract.
- Moved its logic directly inside `StakingRewards` to save external call gas.
- **Gas Improvement:** Reduced the number of external calls, lowering gas usage.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Packed Multiple Variables into a Single Storage Slot

- **Before:** Some variables were stored separately, increasing SLOAD costs.
- **After:** Related variables were combined into a single slot when possible.
- **Gas Improvement:** Less storage access, reducing SLOAD cost (cold -> warm reads).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Used Constant Slot Numbers for Variables

- Assigned slot numbers to important variables as constants.
- **Benefit:** Yul code can access storage directly using slot numbers.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Created Getters in Yul

- Implemented getters using Yul with direct slot access.
- **Gas Improvement:** Direct slot access instead of Solidity‚Äôs default storage handling.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Created Setters in Yul

- Implemented setters using Yul with direct slot assignments.
- **Gas Improvement:** More efficient storage updates.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Moved Complex Computations to Yul

- **Before:** Solidity handled expensive calculations within functions.
- **After:** Optimized using inline Yul.
- **Gas Improvement:** Lower opcode execution costs, improved efficiency.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented Require Checks in Yul

- **Before:** Solidity `require(condition, "error message")`
- **After:** Yul `if iszero(condition) { revert(...) }`
- **Gas Improvement:** Saves gas because strings are expensive in `require()`.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Event Logging with `log1`, `log2`

- Used **low-level event logging in Yul (`log1`, `log2`)**.
- **Gas Improvement:** Direct event writing reduced the overhead of Solidity event emissions.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented Transfer Function in Yul

- **Before:** Solidity‚Äôs `transfer()` was used.
- **After:** Used Yul‚Äôs `call()` for gas efficiency.
- **Gas Improvement:** Reduced external call gas cost.

### üîü Implemented Update Function in Yul

- Similar optimization as the transfer function.
- **Benefit:** Lower gas cost per execution.
