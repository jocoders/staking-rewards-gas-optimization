# Gas Optimization Audit Report - StakingRewards

## Overview

- **Contract Audited:** StakingRewards.sol & StakingRewardsOptimized.sol
- **Optimization Techniques Used:** Yul optimizations, slot packing, inline assembly, gas-efficient event logging, custom errors
- **Audit Focus:** Reducing gas costs for deployment and function execution
- **Findings Summary:**
  - **Deployment Gas Reduced:** 2,160,624 -> 1,548,556 (↓ 28.3%)
  - **Deployment Size Reduced:** 10,073 -> 7,349 (↓ 27.1%)
  - **Gas Savings on Function Calls:** Significant reductions across multiple functions

## Optimizations & Gas Savings

### 1️⃣ Moved RewardsDistributionRecipient Logic Inside Contract

- Previously, the contract used an external `RewardsDistributionRecipient` contract.
- Moved its logic directly inside `StakingRewards` to save external call gas.
- **Gas Improvement:** Reduced the number of external calls, lowering gas usage.

### 2️⃣ Packed Multiple Variables into a Single Storage Slot

- **Before:** Some variables were stored separately, increasing SLOAD costs.
- **After:** Related variables were combined into a single slot when possible.
- **Gas Improvement:** Less storage access, reducing SLOAD cost (cold -> warm reads).

### 3️⃣ Used Constant Slot Numbers for Variables

- Assigned slot numbers to important variables as constants.
- **Benefit:** Yul code can access storage directly using slot numbers without hashing.

### 4️⃣ & 5️⃣ Created Getters & Setters in Yul

- Rewrote getter and setter functions in Yul.
- **Gas Improvement:** Direct slot access instead of using Solidity’s default storage handling.
- **Example Getter in Yul:**
  ```solidity
  function getStoredValue() external view returns (uint256 result) {
      assembly {
          result := sload(0x01)  // Direct storage slot access
      }
  }
  ```

### 6️⃣ Moved Complex Computations to Yul

- **Before:** Solidity handled expensive calculations within functions.
- **After:** Optimized using inline Yul.
- **Gas Improvement:** Lower opcode execution costs, improved efficiency.

### 7️⃣ Implemented Require Checks in Yul

- **Before:** Solidity `require(condition, "error message")`
- **After:** Yul `if iszero(condition) { revert(...) }`
- **Gas Improvement:** Custom revert logic costs less gas than default Solidity errors.

### 8️⃣ Optimized Event Logging with `log1`, `log2`

- Used **low-level event logging in Yul (`log1`, `log2`)**.
- **Gas Improvement:** Direct event writing reduced the overhead of Solidity event emissions.

### 9️⃣ Implemented Transfer Function in Yul

- **Before:** Solidity’s `transfer()` was used.
- **After:** Used Yul’s `call()` for gas efficiency.
- **Gas Improvement:** Reduced external call gas cost.

### 🔟 Implemented Update Function in Yul

- Similar optimization as the transfer function.
- **Benefit:** Lower gas cost per execution.

### 🔥 Implemented Custom Errors

- **Before:** `require(condition, "error message")` (expensive)
- **After:** Custom errors (`error InvalidState();` in Yul)
- **Gas Improvement:** Saves gas because strings are expensive in `require()`.
